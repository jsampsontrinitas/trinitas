# Interactive 3D Cube Demo

This example demonstrates how to create an interactive 3D cube using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The cube has six colored faces with labels, can be animated (spin and pulsate), and allows for interactive transparency changes when clicking on its faces. This is intended as a self-documented example rather than a step-by-step tutorial.

The code in this demo showcases how the three core web technologies work together to create interactive web elements. The HTML (index.html) provides the structure for the cube and its controls, applying appropriate IDs and classes that will be targeted by both CSS and JavaScript. The CSS (styles.css) handles all visual aspects including the cube's 3D positioning, colors, animations, and dark mode support using CSS custom properties, transforms, and keyframe animations. The JavaScript (scripts.js) provides interactivity by handling events, toggling CSS classes to control animations, and directly manipulating CSS properties to change opacity when faces are clicked.

By examining the code and its extensive documentation, you'll gain an understanding of how to represent 3D objects in a web browser without WebGL or other specialized 3D libraries. You'll see practical examples of CSS features like nested selectors, 3D transforms, custom properties, and animations. The JavaScript demonstrates event handling, DOM manipulation, and element property changes in response to user actions. The code is structured to showcase important programming principles including separation of concerns, progressive enhancement, and unobtrusive JavaScript patterns, making it an excellent reference for modern front-end development techniques.
