  HTML CONCEPTS COVERED IN THIS FILE
  ---------------------------------
  
  HTML FEATURES:
  - Semantic Structure: Using appropriate div elements for content organization
  - Form Controls: Checkboxes for toggling functionality
  - Input Labels: Associating labels with their corresponding inputs
  - ID Attributes: Providing unique identifiers for JavaScript interaction
  - Class Attributes: Applying CSS styles and enabling JavaScript selection
  - Element Nesting: Creating parent-child relationships for structure
  - Informational Elements: Using span for help text
  - Component Structure: Creating a complex 3D cube from multiple elements
  
  GENERAL PRINCIPLES/IDEAS:
  - User Interface Design: Creating intuitive controls for interaction
  - Separation of Concerns: Structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), behavior (JS)
  - Progressive Enhancement: Base functionality with optional features
  - Accessibility Considerations: Proper label associations for form controls
  - Component-Based Architecture: Building complex UI from simple components
  - Interactive Elements: Creating elements that respond to user actions
  - Visual Feedback: Providing information about available interactions
  - 3D Representation: Using 2D elements to create a 3D visual experience
  - Mental Model Mapping: UI controls directly correspond to visual effects
-->

<!-- The options div contains the user interface controls for the 3D cube.
     It has three checkbox controls that toggle different visual effects and
     a help text that informs users they can click cube faces to change transparency. -->
     <div id="options">
        <!-- The "Pulsate" checkbox toggles the pulsate animation.
             When checked, the cube will grow and shrink in a breathing effect.
             The "for" attribute is implied by nesting the input inside the label. -->
        <label>Pulsate <input type="checkbox" id="pulsate" /></label>
      
        <!-- The "Spin" checkbox toggles the spin animation.
             When checked, the cube will rotate in 3D space.
             The ID "spin" allows JavaScript to identify this control and apply the corresponding class. -->
        <label>Spin <input type="checkbox" id="spin" /></label>
      
        <!-- The "Labels" checkbox toggles the visibility of text labels on each face of the cube.
             The JavaScript uses this ID to toggle a class on the cube element. -->
        <label>Labels <input type="checkbox" id="labels" /></label>
      
        <!-- This informational span provides a hint about additional interaction capabilities.
             The CSS styles this with a help cursor to indicate it contains helpful information. -->
        <span>Click cube faces to toggle transparency</span>
      </div>
      
      <!-- The box-container div serves as a wrapper for the 3D cube.
           It's styled with flexbox to center the cube within the available space. -->
      <div class="box-container">
        <!-- The box div is the main container for our 3D cube.
             It has CSS properties that set its size and initial 3D transformation.
             JavaScript can add classes to this element to trigger animations. -->
        <div class="box">
          <!-- Each of the following divs represents one face of the 3D cube.
               They are positioned in 3D space using CSS transforms.
               The class names indicate their position (top, front, back, etc.).
               Each face has a different color applied via CSS.
               The ::after pseudo-element in CSS is used to add the text labels.
               Clicking on these faces will toggle their transparency via JavaScript. -->

          <div class="face front"></div>
