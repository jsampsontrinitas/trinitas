    <!-- This script tag has a few attributes:
            - [type]
                Indicates the type of script in the file.
                In our case, it's a "module", meaning processing of the script
                will be deferred until after the page has been loaded.
                By declaring our index.js script to be a "module" type, we can
                now use keywords like "import" within!

            - [src]
                This should already be familiar to us; it is the address or
                location of the file we'd like to load. In our case it's a
                simple filename.

            - [defer]
                This is no longer needed, now that we have [type='module'].
                We used [defer] earlier to make sure the document had finished
                loading before our script code would be executed.
